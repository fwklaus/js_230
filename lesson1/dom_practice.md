1. False: there is not a direct one-to-one mapping between tags that appear in an HTML file and the nodes in the DOM. The browser automatically inserts omissions in the HTML that are left out because they are optional or because the markup is invalid. Text and whitespace also have nodes that don't map to tags

2. True: text nodes someimes contain nothing but whitespace. These text node can also be referred to as empty nodes. They consist of whitespace characters, newline characters, etc.
